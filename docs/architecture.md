# Architecture Guide

This guide provides an overview of the Cortex architecture, its components, and how they interact.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

See the [Architecture Decision Records](./adrs) for more detailed information on specific architectural decisions.

## External Scheduler Delegation

Cortex can be integrated with scheduling services like Nova, OpenStack's compute service. Cortex is integrated in a delegation mode, which means the following.

When new VMs are created or existing ones moved, Nova selects the right compute host as follows:

1. **Filtering Phase:** Nova retrieves all possible compute hosts. Hosts on which the VM cannot be placed are filtered out.
2. **Weighing Phase:** Nova ranks the remaining hosts based on a set of criteria.
3. **Scheduling Phase:** Nova orders the hosts based on the ranking and schedules the VM on the highest-ranked host. If this process fails, Nova moves to the next host in the list.

Cortex inserts an additional step:

```diff
1. Filtering Phase
2. Weighing Phase
+ 3. Call Cortex
4. Scheduling Phase
```

Cortex receives the list of possible hosts and their weights from Nova. It then calculates a new ranking based on the current state of the data center and returns the updated list to Nova. Nova then continues with the scheduling phase.

> [!NOTE]
> Since, by default, Nova does not support calling an external service, this functionality needs to be added like in [SAP's fork of Nova](https://github.com/sapcc/nova/blob/stable/2023.2-m3/nova/scheduler/external.py).
