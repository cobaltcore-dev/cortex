          The Cortex service is down. Initial placement requests from Nova will
          not be served. This is no immediate problem, since Nova will continue
          placing new VMs. However, the placement will be less desirable.

          Cortex is responding to Nova initial placement requests with HTTP 4xx
          errors. This is expected when the scheduling request cannot be served
          by Cortex. However, it could also indicate that the Nova request
          format has changed and Cortex is unable to parse it.

          Cortex is responding to Nova initial placement requests with HTTP 5xx
          errors. This is not expected and indicates that Cortex is having some
          internal problem. Nova will continue to place new VMs, but the
          placement will be less desirable. Thus, no immediate action is needed.

          Cortex is expected to return a response to Nova initial placement
          requests within 1 second. If the response takes longer, it indicates
          that Cortex is no longer able to serve the requests in a timely manner.
          No immediate action is needed, since Nova sets its own timeout and
          will fallback to its own, less desirable placement.

          the sync module will retry the sync operation and the currently synced
          data will be kept. However, when this problem persists for a longer
          time the service will have a less recent view of the datacenter.
