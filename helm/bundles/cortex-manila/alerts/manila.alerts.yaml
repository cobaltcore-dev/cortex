      description: >
        The Cortex initial placement is down. Initial placement requests from Manila will
        not be served. This is no immediate problem, since Manila will continue
        placing new shares. However, the placement will be less desirable.

      summary: "Cortex syncer is down"
      description: >
        The Cortex syncer is down. Cortex requires somewhat recent data from
        it's datasources (OpenStack, Prometheus, etc.) to make accurate
        scheduling decisions. If this issue persists for a longer time, the
        data based will slowly drift away from the actual state of the
        datacenter, which may lead to less desirable placement decisions.
        This is no immediate problem, since Manila will continue placing new
        shares.

        The Cortex extractor is down. This means that newly available data
        about the datacenter will not be used to extract scheduling knowledge.
        This is no immediate problem, since Manila will continue placing new
        shares. However, the placement will be less desirable.

        Cortex is responding to Manila initial placement requests with HTTP 4xx
        errors. This is expected when the scheduling request cannot be served
        by Cortex. However, it could also indicate that the Manila request
        format has changed and Cortex is unable to parse it.

        Cortex is responding to Manila initial placement requests with HTTP 5xx
        errors. This is not expected and indicates that Cortex is having some
        internal problem. Manila will continue to place new shares, but the
        placement will be less desirable. Thus, no immediate action is needed.

        Cortex experienced an issue syncing data from a datasource. This may

        the sync module is misconfigured. No immediate action is needed, since
        the sync module will retry the sync operation and the currently synced
        data will be kept. However, when this problem persists for a longer
        time the service will have a less recent view of the datacenter.

        Cortex is syncing more than 1 million objects from a datasource. This
        may happen when the datasource (OpenStack, Prometheus, etc.) returns
        unexpectedly many objects, or when the database cannot drop old objects.
        No immediate action is needed, but should this condition persist for a
        longer time, the database may fill up and crash.
