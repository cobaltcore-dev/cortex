spec:

  description: |
    Nova provides virtual machine placement on compute hosts for OpenStack.
    After applying its own filtering and weighing logic, it delegates to cortex
    for additional filtering and weighing via this external scheduler pipeline.
    Cortex returns a ranked list of hosts back to nova for final selection.

  name: nova-external-scheduler-reservations
spec:
  operator: cortex-nova
  description: |
    This pipeline can be used to place reservations the same way nova would place
    its virtual machines. It uses the same filtering steps as implemented in the
    nova service, ensuring a valid placement of the reservation. It then leverages
    cortex's weighing steps to provide an optimized host selection for the reservation.
