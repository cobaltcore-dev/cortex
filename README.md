Cortex is a modular and extensible service for initial placement and scheduling in cloud-native environments covering workloads such as compute, storage, network, and other scheduling domains.  
It improves resource utilization and operational performance by making smart placement decisions based on the current state of the environment and defined constraints and objectives.

As part of the CobaltCore project, it complements the platform with advanced placement and scheduling capabilities.  

Learn more about [CobaltCore](https://cobaltcore-dev.github.io/docs/) and the broader [Apeiro Reference Architecture](https://apeirora.eu) ecosystem.

## Features

- **Modular and extensible design**  
  Cortex consists of a minimal core framework that can be extended with various plugins to support different data sources and scheduling algorithms. 
  This provides flexibility and enables adapting Cortex to various environments and requirements.

- **Centralized knowledge database**
  Cortex provides a holistic knowledge database that stores enriched data from various sources.
  This enables efficient and consistent access to the infrastructure state for placement and scheduling decisions.

- **Integrated placement and scheduling**  
  Cortex combines initial placement and continuous scheduling into a single service.

- **Cross-domain support**  
  Cortex supports a wide range of workloads from various scheduling domains, including compute, storage, network, and Kubernetes. 
  The architecture allows handling the domains either independently or through coordinated multi-domain decisions.

- **Performance and scalability**
  Cortex is designed for production-scale deployments using algorithmic approaches to balance decision quality, execution efficiency, and maintaining a low resource footprint.
  It is battle-tested in large-scale, production cloud computing environments and can handle thousands of placement requests per second.
